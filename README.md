# Rakamin Mini Project
## Investigate Business Hotel using Data Visualization

### **Objective**
The primary goal of this project is to delve into customer behavior concerning hotel reservations and to ascertain its correlation with the rate of hotel booking cancellations.

### **Procedure**
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Conclusion

### **Tools Used**
- Jupyter Notebook

### **Results**
- The uptick in hotel reservations can be attributed to specific periods/events such as:
  - Eid al-Fitr in June.
  - Christmas and year-end festivities in December.
  - End-of-semester student holidays spanning June, July, and December.
- City hotels experience a more substantial volume of bookings compared to resort hotels.
- Cancellations are more pronounced at city hotels than at resort hotels.
- A prolonged lead time invariably elevates the cancellation rate.

### **Recommendations**
- **Orders with very long lead times tend to have a higher cancel rate.** City hotels and resort hotels need to understand cancellation patterns based on lead times and adjust booking management strategies and cancellation policies accordingly.
- **The gap cancel rate between city hotels and resort hotels is getting wider as the lead time increases,** with a significant difference occurring in the very long lead time category. This shows that city hotels need to pay attention to cancelling bookings at very long lead times. Meanwhile, Resort Hotels show better performance in maintaining bookings with very short lead times
- **The very short lead time category, which is less than a week, shows a lower cancel rate for both types of hotels.** This indicates that orders with that lead time are more stable and not prone to cancellation. City hotels and resort hotels can strengthen their efforts to promote bookings with lead times in this category to increase business stability and profitability.
